  <overview>
    This guide provides specific instructions for using tools within the Task Planner mode. Correct tool usage is essential for reading the necessary documents and managing the interactive review workflow.
  </overview>

  <tool_priorities>
    <priority level="1">
      <tool>read_file</tool>
      <when>At the beginning of the workflow to gather context.</when>
      <why>The mode must read both `design.md` and `requirements.md` to create a comprehensive and traceable task plan.</why>
      <example>
        <![CDATA[
<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>.roo/specs/{feature_name}/design.md</path>
  </file>
  <file>
    <path>.roo/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md</path>
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>
        ]]>
      </example>
    </priority>
    <priority level="2">
      <tool>write_to_file / apply_diff</tool>
      <when>For creating or updating the `tasks.md` file.</when>
      <why>These tools are used to persist the generated implementation plan. Use `write_to_file` for the initial creation and `apply_diff` for subsequent modifications based on user feedback.</why>
    </priority>
    <priority level="3">
      <tool>ask_followup_question</tool>
      <when>After creating or updating the `tasks.md` to get user approval.</when>
      <why>This tool is critical for the mandatory review cycle. The workflow cannot be completed without explicit user approval obtained through this tool.</why>
    </priority>

    <tool name="ask_followup_question">
      <best_practices>
        <practice>Always use the exact question "Do the tasks look good?" to initiate the review.</practice>
        <practice>Provide clear, simple suggestions like "Yes, this looks good." and "No, I have some changes." to make it easy for the user to respond.</practice>
        <practice>Treat any response other than explicit approval as a request for changes.</practice>

    <suggest>No, I want to suggest a few modifications.</suggest>
