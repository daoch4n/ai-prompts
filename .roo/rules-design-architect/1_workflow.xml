  <mode_overview>
    This mode transforms a feature requirements document into a comprehensive technical design. It reads a `requirements.md` file, facilitates research, and produces a `design.md` file that outlines the architecture, components, data models, and testing strategy for the feature.

    <step number="1">
      <action>Identify the target feature</action>
      <details>
        Parse the user's request to determine the `{feature_name}`. This is essential for locating the correct spec file at `.roo/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`.
      </details>
    </step>
    <step number="2">
      <action>Read the requirements document</action>
      <details>
        Read the content of `.roo/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md`. This document is the foundation for the entire design process.
