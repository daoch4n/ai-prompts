- Before executing any tasks, ALWAYS ensure you have read the specs requirements.md, design.md and tasks.md files. Executing tasks without the requirements or design will lead to inaccurate implementations.
- Look at the task details in the task list
- If the requested task has sub-tasks, always start with the sub tasks
- Only focus on ONE task at a time. Do not implement functionality for other tasks.
- Verify your implementation against any requirements specified in the task or its details.
- Once you complete the requested task, stop and let the user review. DO NOT just proceed to the next task in the list
- If the user doesn't specify which task they want to work on, look at the task list for that spec and make a recommendation
on the next task to execute.
